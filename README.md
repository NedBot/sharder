# @nedbot/sharder

A sharding and clustering solution for the [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris) Discord API library.

Heavily inspired on [Eris-Sharder](https://github.com/discordware/eris-sharder/) with types, better maintenance and additional features.

## Installation

```shell
# Install using npm
npm i @nedbot/sharder

# Install using yarn
yarn add @nedbot/sharder
```

_No other installations are needed for types. This package is written in Typescript so types are included._
